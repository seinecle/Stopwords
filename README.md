# Lists of stopwords
- in multiple languages  
- with lists of stopwords for academic types of literature and Twitter


### Focus on the stopwords for the academic literature
These stopwords have been curated "by hand" across a long period of time. Terms are included if they are not specific to a scientific field. Please check if this fits your needs. There are some border cases. For instance, "network" is included, because I judged that the term carries less and less informational value (is becoming less and less specific to a given field or subfield). Users interested in studying corpora network theory / social networks / neural networks might still need to remove it from the list.

### Stopwords for the academic literature in French
This list is currently under construction, but works already pretty well.

### Use
These lists are extremely useful when following a ngram type of approach in topic detection or semantic network analysis. See:
